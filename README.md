# PBI-Service-Validation
This repository contains my work Validation Setup in Power BI Service, where I practiced publishing reports, configuring scheduled refresh, managing access through workspaces, and setting up validation workflows in Power BI Service. It includes the .pbix file and a direct link to view the report online.
